# CanvasCompass - Project 1 - Front-End Skills Bootcamp

## Description

This is our first project for the front-end skills bootcamp. Our project is called CanvasCompass; this application is designed to allow users to find where certain pieces of artwork are located and displayed in the world. The user can either enter the name of a piece of artwork, or the name of an artist and they will be presented with information on where to locate the specified artworks via the OpenStreetMaps API.
